# CC_exam_PoP

This is one on my works I created for the final exam of Codecool's Junior Frontend Developer course. 

According to the task we had to create a data file, use it in the backend, and then fetch it to the frontend. Using React was neccessary, also as a conditional loading.
The theme was freely choosable, so I decided to create a character profile page about the Prince of Persia game trilogy. 
I made this project responsive, so it should look fine on mobiles and tablets too.

After you cloned or pulled this repository, type in 'npm install' in to the terminal to run the application successfully!

If it wouldn't work, than install the following packages:

---Fronted:---

npm install axios

npm install react-router-dom

npm install react-cookie-consent

npm install react-reveal --save


---Backend:---

npm install express --save

npm install cors

npm install body-parser
